<br>
As part of using Molkky, the data we access involve:<br>
<br>
1. your public and local IP address (and ports)<br>
2. your multiplayer activity (who you play, scores, etc)<br>
3. any logs you choose to send<br>
4. your platform unique identifier. (steam/oculus/etc)<br>
5. the account name for your platform account (Which you can change in game)<br>
6. your deviceId/mac address. <br>
7. your device type (quest/vive/rift...)<br>
<br>
The data we share with other users as part of easily visible information:<br>
1. your account name, unless you have changed it (then it'd be whatever you changed it to)<br>
<br>
The data we share programmatically with others that could be pulled from logs:<br>
1. your IP address; the only way to hide this completely from the other 
user would be to force relay functionality...which is detrimental to the
 experience compared to p2p. <br>
<br>
<br>
We do not store any data. 
If you have a question, please send us a request at 
devs@bpvr.eu. <br>
